# IMDB API Sample
IMDB_API is a comprehensive Django REST framework (DRF) project that aims to provide a sample video API similar to IMDb. This project covers a wide range of features, making it an excellent resource for beginners and advanced developers to learn about various aspects of building RESTful APIs with Django and DRF. IMDB_API allows users to interact with a database of movies, manage their watchlists, explore movie details, and even add reviews and ratings.

## ðŸ”¹Key Features:
#### Views: 
The project showcases different views for managing movies, watchlists, and user reviews. It demonstrates how to define API endpoints and handle HTTP requests effectively.

#### Serializers: 
IMDB_API utilizes serializers to convert complex data types, such as model instances, into native Python datatypes and vice versa. This demonstrates how to control the representation of data when sending or receiving JSON.

#### Postman: 
The project includes Postman documentation or collections for testing the API endpoints. This encourages developers to understand and utilize tools for API testing and debugging.

#### Permissions: 
IMDB_API introduces the concept of permissions, allowing developers to control who can access and modify specific parts of the API. You'll learn about different permission classes and how to implement them.

#### Authentications: 
The project covers various authentication methods, including basic authentication, token authentication, and JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. It helps developers understand different ways to secure API endpoints and user data.

#### Throttling: 
IMDB_API demonstrates how to implement throttling to limit the rate at which clients can make requests to the API. This is crucial for controlling API usage and preventing abuse.

#### Searching and Filtering: 
The project provides search and filtering functionality, allowing users to search for movies and apply filters to refine their queries. You'll learn how to implement complex queries on your API data.

#### Testing: 
IMDB_API includes unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the API. You'll see how to write tests to validate your API endpoints and functionality.

#### Ordering: 
Users can sort movie lists based on different criteria, such as release date or ratings. This demonstrates how to implement ordering in your API.

#### Pagination: 
To handle large datasets, IMDB_API includes pagination for movie lists, ensuring that responses are manageable and efficient.

#### User Watchlists: Users can create and manage their movie watchlists, allowing them to keep track of the movies they plan to watch.

#### Movie Details: The API provides detailed information about each movie, including cast, crew, and plot summaries.

#### Reviews and Ratings: Users can add reviews and ratings to movies, showcasing how to handle user-generated content in your API.
